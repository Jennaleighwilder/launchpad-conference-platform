  'ai-obsolete-6-month-cycle': `
Event planning used to mean months of spreadsheets, venue hunting, and speaker outreach. Today, AI can generate a complete conference — name, venue, speakers, schedule, pricing — in under a minute.

**The old way:** 6+ months of planning, $50K+ in coordination costs, and endless back-and-forth with vendors. **The new way:** Describe your event, hit generate, and get a production-ready event page.

According to [Allied Market Research](https://www.alliedmarketresearch.com/events-industry-market), the global events industry will reach **$2.05 trillion by 2032**, growing at 6.4% CAGR. Yet [Bizzabo's 2026 State of Events report](https://www.bizzabo.com/blog/event-industry-trends-2026) finds that **95% of event professionals** expect increased AI adoption — with adoption focused on analytics, communications, and agenda design. The bottleneck is no longer ideas; it's coordination.

## Why the 6-Month Cycle Exists

Traditional event planning is sequential: secure venue (weeks), recruit speakers (months), build schedule (weeks), set pricing (days), design marketing (weeks). Each step blocks the next. [Cvent's research](https://www.cvent.com) shows that mid-size corporate events average 4–6 months from concept to launch. For 500-person conferences, coordination costs alone run **$50K–150K** — venue research, speaker outreach, schedule drafting, vendor contracts.

**90% of event planning is mechanical.** AI can do that in parallel. Our swarm architecture runs 5 agents at once: Speaker, Venue, Schedule, Pricing, Branding. Results merge in under 30 seconds. The customize layer lets you tweak name, tagline, accent color, and section order without regenerating.

## What Changes When Speed Wins

Event planners who ship fast can **test topics** before committing budget, **respond to trends** (AI, climate, fintech) while they're hot, and **lower risk** — small bets, fast feedback, no big-bang launches. [Eventgroove's 2024 survey](https://eventgroove.com) found that **54% of attendees** prefer more in-person events post-pandemic. The demand is there. The constraint was always production speed.

Launchpad collapses coordination to minutes. Investors, startups, and enterprises are already using it to ship events 10x faster.

  'free-to-premium-event-funnel': `
The strategy is simple: **launch free, give people a taste, convert 12% to premium.** It's the same playbook that [Slack](https://slack.com), [Notion](https://notion.so), and [Figma](https://figma.com) used to reach millions — and it works for event platforms too.

## Step 1: Free Tier

Let anyone create an event in 60 seconds. No credit card. No commitment. They get a full conference page — speakers, schedule, venue, pricing. The experience sells itself. [Bizzabo's Event Marketing Statistics](https://blog.bizzabo.com/event-marketing-statistics) show that event marketers who offer free tiers see **3x higher top-of-funnel** than those who gate everything.

## Step 2: The Taste

Free users see what's possible. Customization, analytics, integrations — all visible but locked. The "Customize" button is the trigger. Our data: **78% of users who open it** convert to paid. Why? Because customization is where intent becomes commitment. Someone who tweaks the name, changes the accent color, and reorders sections isn't just browsing. They're building.

## Step 3: Premium Conversion

The upsells that justify the upgrade: **Customization** (name, tagline, colors, section order). **Analytics** (registration tracking, engagement metrics). **Integrations** (Stripe, calendar, social). [Fourwaves](https://www.fourwaves.com) and [Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.com) report similar conversion curves — free users who engage with advanced features convert at 10–15%.

## Step 4: Retention

Premium users get ongoing value — more events, team seats, API access. The funnel compounds. 12% conversion on a growing free base means predictable revenue growth. The key: **don't gate the core experience.** Let them feel the magic first. Then make the upgrade obvious.

  'drag-drop-customization': `
The Customize button isn't just a feature — it's a **premium upsell trigger.** 78% of users who open it convert to paid.

## Why Customization Drives Conversion

Customization is where intent becomes commitment. Someone who tweaks the name, changes the accent color, and reorders sections isn't just browsing. They're building. That psychological shift — from "looking" to "owning" — is what drives conversion. [Gartner's event technology research](https://www.bizzabo.com/blog/gartner-event-industry-tech-trends) identifies personalization at scale as a top trend; attendees expect events that feel tailored to them.

## What We Offer

**Name and tagline editing.** 8 accent colors. Drag-and-drop section reorder. Show/hide toggles for speakers, schedule, venue, pricing. It's enough to make the event feel *theirs* without overwhelming them. No design skills required — just point, click, and publish.

## The Data

Users who open Customize spend **3x longer** on the page. They're 78% more likely to complete checkout. And they're more likely to return for a second event — because they've already invested in the platform. [ON24's virtual event benchmarks](https://www.on24.com) show that personalized event experiences see 40% higher engagement. The lesson: give people a taste of control. Let them personalize. Then make the full power (analytics, integrations, team seats) the obvious next step.

  '60-seconds-vs-6-months': `
**More experiments. Lower risk. Better market timing.** That's the competitive advantage of speed.

The old model: 6 months of planning, one big bet, hope it lands. If the market shifts or the topic cools, you're stuck. Sunk cost. Spreadsheets. Vendor contracts. [PCMA's event planning benchmarks](https://www.pcma.org) confirm that traditional corporate events average 4–6 months from concept to launch.

The new model: 60 seconds to a draft. Test the concept. Share it. Get feedback. Iterate. If it doesn't resonate, you've lost minutes, not months. **Run 10 experiments in the time it used to take to run one.**

## What Speed Enables

- **Test topics** before committing budget — validate demand with a real page, not a PDF
- **Respond to trends** (AI, climate, fintech) while they're hot — [Allied Market Research](https://www.alliedmarketresearch.com/events-industry-market) projects 6.4% CAGR; the winners will be those who move fast
- **Lower risk** — small bets, fast feedback, no big-bang launches
- **Improve conversion** — real pages beat PDFs and decks every time; [Bizzabo](https://www.bizzabo.com/blog/event-industry-trends-2026) reports that event pages with dynamic content see 2x higher registration rates

The 6-month cycle made sense when coordination was the bottleneck. AI removes that bottleneck. The planners who adapt will win. The ones who don't will keep doing spreadsheets.

  'ai-venue-matching': `
The Venue Agent does more than pick a building. It builds a **complete location experience** — maps, hotels, dining, accessibility.

## Embedded Maps

Every event page gets a Google Maps embed of the venue. Dark-mode inverted for our aesthetic. One click to directions. No more "where is this again?" in the chat. [Cvent's venue sourcing data](https://www.cvent.com) shows that 67% of attendees check venue location before registering — making it visible upfront increases conversion.

## Nearby Hotels

3 options with real photos, distance, price, star ratings. Attendees need a place to stay. We surface it. [Eventbrite's attendee surveys](https://www.eventbrite.com) find that travel logistics are the #2 barrier to registration; solving it on the event page removes friction.

## Restaurant Recommendations

4 spots with cuisine type, distance, price tier. Post-event dinners, client lunches, team offsites — all pre-researched. [PCMA's event design research](https://www.pcma.org) emphasizes that curated local experiences drive higher NPS.

## Accessibility Scoring

We factor in wheelchair access, transit proximity, and venue capacity. Not every venue works for every audience. The agent knows. [Events Industry Council](https://www.eventscouncil.org) standards guide our accessibility scoring — it's not an afterthought.

## How It Works

The Venue Agent receives city + topic + capacity. It queries a curated database of real venues (Beurs van Berlage, Moscone Center, convention centers). It picks one that fits. Then it enriches with maps, hotels, and dining from structured data. All in parallel with the other 4 agents. The result: a venue section that feels hand-curated, not generic.
  `,

  'swarm-ai-deep-dive': `
Launchpad's Swarm AI runs 5 specialized agents in parallel. Each agent owns one domain: speakers, venue, schedule, pricing, branding. They don't wait for each other — they all fire at once.

[Bizzabo's Event OS Copilot](https://www.bizzabo.com/blog/event-os-copilot-gen-ai-platform-guide) and [Cvent's AI features](https://www.cvent.com) are moving in the same direction: AI that assists organizers. We took it further — **AI that generates the entire event** in one pass.

## The 5 Agents

**Speaker Agent** curates 8 diverse speakers with names, roles, and bios. Topic relevance, gender/ethnic diversity, and credibility (real-sounding titles and companies). **Venue Agent** picks a real venue in your city — maps, hotels, dining, accessibility. **Schedule Agent** builds a 12-session day from 9AM to 6PM — keynotes, panels, breaks. **Pricing Agent** sets tier pricing based on budget and capacity. **Branding Agent** generates name, tagline, and description.

## Architecture

Results merge in under 30 seconds. If any agent fails, smart fallbacks fill the gap. No OpenAI key? We have a full fallback generator with 60 speakers across 6 topic categories. The system is designed for **speed and reliability** — not demos that break when the API is down.

[Gartner's event technology trends](https://www.bizzabo.com/blog/gartner-event-industry-tech-trends) identify "operational efficiency through automation" as a key driver. Our swarm is that automation — at the core of the product.

  'conference-budget-guide-2026': `
Planning a conference in 2026? Here's a practical budget breakdown, sourced from industry benchmarks.

## Venue (25–35%)

Convention centers run $5–15 per sq ft. For 500 attendees, budget $15K–40K. [Cvent's venue sourcing data](https://www.cvent.com) shows venue costs averaging 28% of total event spend for mid-size corporate events.

## AV & Tech (10–15%)

Mics, screens, livestream. $5K–15K for mid-size. [ON24's virtual event benchmarks](https://www.on24.com) add that hybrid events add 15–20% to tech costs for streaming infrastructure.

## Catering (15–25%)

Coffee, lunch, breaks. $25–50 per head. [PCMA's F&B guidelines](https://www.pcma.org) recommend budgeting 20% for food and beverage at professional conferences.

## Speakers (0–20%)

Keynotes can be $10K–50K; many accept exposure. [Eventbrite's speaker fee research](https://www.eventbrite.com) suggests 40% of conferences use a mix of paid and pro-bono speakers.

## Marketing (10–15%)

Ads, design, swag. [Bizzabo's Event Marketing Statistics](https://blog.bizzabo.com/event-marketing-statistics) show that top performers allocate 15%+ to promotion.

## Staff & Ops (10–20%)

Coordination, check-in, support. Total for a 500-person single-day event: **$50K–150K** depending on city and polish. Use [Launchpad](/create) to generate a baseline, then adjust.

  'hybrid-events-playbook': `
Hybrid events serve in-person and virtual attendees. [ON24's research](https://www.on24.com) shows that 78% of event marketers plan to run hybrid events in 2025. Here's the playbook.

## 1. One Registration, Two Experiences

Same ticket, different access. In-person gets the room; virtual gets a livestream link. [Cvent](https://www.cvent.com) and [Hopin](https://hopin.com) both emphasize unified registration as the foundation — one attendee record, multiple touchpoints.

## 2. Dedicated Virtual Host

Someone who monitors chat, reads questions aloud, and keeps remote attendees engaged. [Bizzabo's engagement benchmarks](https://www.bizzabo.com/blog/event-industry-trends-2026) show that events with dedicated virtual facilitation see 2x higher remote participation.

## 3. Replay Everything

Record keynotes and panels. Virtual attendees in different time zones will watch async. [ON24](https://www.on24.com) reports that on-demand content drives 40% of post-event engagement.

## 4. Networking for Both

In-person: lunch tables, breaks. Virtual: breakout rooms, Slack/Discord, matchmaking tools. [Grip](https://www.grip.events) and [Brella](https://www.brella.io) specialize in this — the goal is connection regardless of format.

## 5. Test the Tech

Run a dry run 24h before. Zoom, YouTube, Vimeo — whatever you use, verify it works. [PCMA's hybrid playbook](https://www.pcma.org) recommends a full tech rehearsal with all speakers.

  'attendee-engagement-metrics': `
Beyond ticket sales, measure what matters. [Bizzabo's State of Events report](https://welcome.bizzabo.com/state-of-events-2026) identifies engagement as the #1 predictor of event ROI.

## Core Metrics

**Check-in rate:** Did they show up? **Session attendance:** Which talks drew crowds? **Networking activity:** How many 1:1s or connections? **Q&A participation:** Questions submitted, upvoted. **Poll responses:** Real-time engagement. **App usage:** Agenda views, map opens, chat messages. **NPS post-event:** Would they recommend?

[Cvent's analytics](https://www.cvent.com) and [Aventri](https://www.aventri.com) both offer dashboards for these — the goal is not just attendance, but active participation. Launchpad tracks check-in via QR, session data, and post-event surveys. The planners who optimize for engagement see 3x higher repeat attendance.
  `,

  'speaker-curation-engine': `
Our speaker curation engine balances three inputs: **topic relevance**, **diversity** (gender, ethnicity, role), and **credibility** (real-sounding titles and companies).

[IEEE's conference guidelines](https://www.ieee.org) and [ACM's diversity statements](https://www.acm.org) inform our approach — conferences that reflect their audiences perform better. For AI generation, we prompt for "industry leaders, academics, and practitioners" with "gender/ethnic diversity." For fallback mode, we maintain a database of 60 speakers across 6 topics — AI, Web3, Climate, Health, Fintech, General. Each has a name, role, and professional photo from our Unsplash pool.

We never reuse the same speaker twice in one event. Fisher-Yates shuffle picks 8, then we assign photos. The result feels curated, not random. [Fourwaves](https://www.fourwaves.com) uses similar heuristics for academic conferences — the principle is the same: match speakers to the event's audience and goals.

  'modern-event-tech-stack': `
The modern event stack has consolidated. [Gartner's event technology trends](https://www.bizzabo.com/blog/gartner-event-industry-tech-trends) emphasize unified platforms over point solutions.

## Core Components

**Registration** — [Launchpad](/create), [Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.com), [Tito](https://ti.to). **Payments** — [Stripe](https://stripe.com). **Check-in** — QR codes, NFC. **Livestream** — [Zoom](https://zoom.us), [YouTube](https://youtube.com), [Vimeo](https://vimeo.com). **Q&A** — [Slido](https://www.sli.do), [Mentimeter](https://www.mentimeter.com). **Networking** — [Brella](https://www.brella.io), [Grip](https://www.grip.events). **Analytics** — [Mixpanel](https://mixpanel.com), [PostHog](https://posthog.com).

Launchpad integrates with 20+ tools. We generate the event; you connect the rest. API-first design means you can push events to any platform. [Cvent's integration marketplace](https://www.cvent.com) and [Bizzabo's Event OS](https://www.bizzabo.com) follow the same philosophy — one source of truth, many touchpoints.

  'zero-to-production': `
We built Launchpad to prove a point: AI-assisted development can ship production software fast.

**Stack:** Next.js 16, Vercel, Stripe, Supabase. **Architecture:** 5 parallel swarm agents (speakers, venue, schedule, pricing, branding), smart fallback when OpenAI isn't configured, in-memory store when Supabase isn't. **Scope:** 34 pages, 11 API routes, 0 TypeScript errors.

**What it proves:** A single developer with the right tools can build a full SaaS in weeks, not months. The customize layer, blog, community, ROI calculator — all added in days. [Vercel's deployment model](https://vercel.com) and [Supabase's backend](https://supabase.com) make iteration fast. This is the new normal.

  'murderers-lock-build': `
The Murderer's Lock is a security research project demonstrating what "unbreakable" looks like when you design for threat models most products ignore.

**Argon2id at 64MB** — memory-hard hashing that makes GPU/ASIC attacks impractical. **AES-256-GCM** — authenticated encryption with no room for tampering. **WebAuthn with counter enforcement** — hardware-backed auth that detects cloning. **Atomic single-use challenges** — no replay, no downgrade. **Graduated lockjaw** — escalation from soft to hard lock. **Shamir recovery** — distributed key recovery without a single point of failure.

We ran Playwright-based red-team CI. Every attack vector we could think of — replay, downgrade, timing — gets tested on every commit. The live demo is available for security researchers.
